# Node Project Blueprint

Getting started using NodeJS with bundled package you need.

## Build In

- `Babel 7` as es6 transformer
- `Mocha` as unit testing
- `NYC` as code coverage report
- `ESLint` as code linter

## Using

First you need clone this repository or download it.

Next, just run `npm install` on terminal to install all dependecy needed.

That's it. And to be clear this blueprint project is my workflow to getting done with nodejs project. I build this repository is for my self to match with my coding workflow after all.
